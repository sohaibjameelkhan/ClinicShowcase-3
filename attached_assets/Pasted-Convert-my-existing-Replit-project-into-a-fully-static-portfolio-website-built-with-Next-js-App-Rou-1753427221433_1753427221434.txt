Convert my existing Replit project into a fully static portfolio website built with Next.js (App Router).

Right now, my project includes backend code using Express and Vite, but I want to completely remove the backend and server logic.

ðŸ”§ Steps to Perform:
âœ… Delete all backend-related files/folders:

server/

shared/

vite.config.ts

Any Express or Vite-related scripts in package.json

Any tsx server runners

âœ… Update package.json scripts to only use Next.js:

json
Copy
Edit
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build && next export",
  "start": "next start"
}
âœ… Uninstall unnecessary backend packages:

Run the following in the terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm uninstall express vite tsx @vitejs/plugin-react @replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal @replit/vite-plugin-cartographer nanoid
âœ… Ensure project is structured like a proper static Next.js site:

Uses the App Router (/app folder)

Static files like images, resume PDF, etc. are inside /public

Reusable components are in /components

Tailwind is set up in /styles and tailwind.config.js

âœ… Update next.config.js to enable static export:

js
Copy
Edit
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true
  }
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
âœ… Ensure Tailwind CSS and animation libraries are working:

Tailwind CSS is configured and imported

Anime.js, Framer Motion, and Three.js (or React Three Fiber) are installed

Animations are working statically (no backend-triggered effects)

âœ… Ensure the site builds statically using:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
It should output to /out for static deployment.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
A completely static portfolio website using:

Next.js (App Router)

Tailwind CSS

Anime.js (for text animations)

Framer Motion (for page transitions)

React Three Fiber or Three.js (for 3D hero background)

The site should be fully exportable using next export and deployable on Vercel or GitHub Pages, with no reliance on any backend server or API.
